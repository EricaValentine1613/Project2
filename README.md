# User Stories
1. As someone who has just discovered GIPHs, I wanted to search through GIPHs, so I used the search bar to find cute GIPHs.
2. Being someone who loves animals, I wanted to see cute pictures of cats, so I searched for cat GIPHs using the search option.
3. As someone who wanted to use a GIPH for the first time, I was trying to find a GIPH that expressed my mood and was able to do so using the search bar.
