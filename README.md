Anyone can search for and save any GIPH that they want.
You can use the search bar to look up different GIPHs and you can save your favorite ones on the Saved page.
GIPH Developers, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
1. The website could be more aesthetically pleasing. 2. More functions can be added. 3. An upgraded version where you can create your own account.
I wanted to search for GIPHs, so I typed what I was looking for in the search bar.
I wanted to save my favorite GIPHs, so i saved them using the 'save' feature.
I was trying to find a GIPH that expressed my mood and was able to do so using the search bar.
